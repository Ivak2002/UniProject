                <p>
                    At <span>IvakaComputers</span>, our story doesn't begin with a flashy startup or major funding — it
                    begins
                    with a dusty desk, a few used PC parts, and a dream.

                    In the early days, we were just a small team of tech lovers friends who were obsessed with building
                    custom PCs
                    and pushing hardware to its limits. We started in a garage, troubleshooting motherboards late into
                    the night,
                    learning the ins and outs of performance optimization, and delivering machines that outperformed
                    expectations.
                    What drove us wasn't profit, but passion: the thrill of helping someone get the best rig for their
                    needs,
                    whether they were a gamer, a content creator, or a business owner.

                    As word spread, more people began to trust us—not just for our hardware knowledge, but for our
                    honesty. We
                    didn't upsell or hide behind technical jargon. We helped people make smart choices, guided by what
                    was best
                    for them—not for our bottom line.

                    Today, <span>IvakaComputers</span> has grown into a trusted name in PC parts and custom builds.
                    We've expanded
                    our reach, partnered with top-tier manufacturers, and built a reputation on reliability, clarity,
                    and
                    world-class support. But no matter how much we grow, we still carry that same spirit that got us
                    started—hands-on, customer-first, and always excited to build something amazing with you.

                <h3>We Started with a Laggy PC and a Dream</h3>

                <p>
                    You could say <span>IvakaComputers</span> was born out of frustration — the kind every gamer knows.
                    That
                    moment when your frame rate drops mid-boss fight, your ping spikes in the middle of a match, or your
                    rig
                    sounds like it's about to take off just running a game launcher.

                    We were just a group of friends back then — gamers, modders, and hardware geeks who loved building
                    PCs almost
                    as much as playing on them. We couldn't afford top-of-the-line parts, but we could learn. We spent
                    weekends
                    tweaking BIOS settings, swapping GPUs, and helping friends fix their builds. Eventually, more people
                    started
                    asking for help. A Reddit post turned into a Discord channel. A couple of builds turned into a whole
                    spreadsheet of orders. That's how <span>IvakaComputers</span> was born.

                    We never set out to become a company — we just wanted to make gaming better. But that mission has
                    stuck with
                    us. Today, we help gamers across the country build powerful rigs without blowing their budget. We
                    test every
                    component, handpick our parts, and offer real advice — because we've been there.

                    At <span>IvakaComputers</span>, we're not just a shop. We're your teammate, your tech support, your
                    trusted
                    hardware squad. Whether you're climbing the ranks or just want smooth gameplay, we've got your back.
                    Game on.

                <h3>Engineering Performance from Day One</h3>
                <img class="image-about" src="{% static 'images/about-page-image-three.png' %}"

                <p>
                    When we started <span>IvakaComputers</span>, we weren't thinking about logos, marketing, or fancy
                    product
                    pages. We were thinking about airflow, latency, bottlenecks, and benchmarks.

                    As engineers and system builders, we saw a gap in the market — too many people were overpaying for
                    underperforming hardware. Too many “custom” builds were just slapped together, without thermal
                    testing or
                    component balancing. We knew we could do better.

                    So we took a different approach. We brought engineering discipline into the world of PC building. We
                    tested
                    every configuration. We optimized cable routing for airflow. We verified PSU loads, memory
                    compatibility, and
                    BIOS stability. We didn't just sell parts — we delivered systems built to last, designed to perform.

                    <span>IvakaComputers</span> was created for people who care about what's inside the case. For
                    creators
                    rendering 4K footage, gamers chasing max FPS, and developers who need absolute reliability, we're
                    here with
                    systems you can trust — built on data, not guesswork.

                    We don't believe in fluff. We believe in numbers. And we'll help you find the build that delivers
                    exactly what
                    you need — no more, no less.

                <p>
                    In the early days, we were just regular folks helping others on forums and Discord. We shared build
                    advice,
                    made compatibility charts, posted GPU reviews, and cheered when someone got their new setup running
                    for the
                    first time. It wasn't about business — it was about belonging. A place where no question was too
                    basic, and
                    every win was celebrated.

                    Over time, more people came to us for advice — and we were happy to help. We started sourcing parts
                    for
                    friends, building rigs, offering honest feedback, and eventually, shipping out complete systems. Our
                    reputation grew not because we advertised, but because people talked. And they trusted us to do
                    right by them.

                    That trust is everything to us. Today, <span>IvakaComputers</span> is bigger — we've got a
                    storefront, a
                    fulfillment team, and thousands of customers — but we're still rooted in the same values: community,
                    kindness,
                    and straight-up love for building awesome PCs.

                    When you shop with us, you're not just placing an order. You're joining a community of builders,
                    gamers,
                    creators, and curious minds who love helping each other level up.
